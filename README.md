A repository for Assignment 5
Describes the problem:
Our problem examined data regarding income levels of employees of a HR company which would aid the HR department. It compaared employees with attrition versus employees without attrition and compared different statistics such as minimum, maximum and average. We found different trands related to the distribution of of income levels related to age, and other factors which would be as expected in that income generally rised with more age and experience. A few outliers were detected but did not significantly skew the data. The directory structure of the project is that we have instructions document how to import and load the data, followed by transformations and aggregations we can perform for different analysis purposes, followed by visualizations created in Excel and finally this README.
